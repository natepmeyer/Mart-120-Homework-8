            <h1>My Story</h1>

            I am originally from Cincinnati, OH and have now been living in Montana for 9 years.
            I am active outdoors all seasons of the year and enjoy traveling 
            out of the country from time to time. Other than photography and 
            trips out of the country I enjoy backpacking, skiing, and surfing. 
            As I continue my path at the University of Montana in Media Arts I hope to 
            engage with the community and learn from the people that do it best while 
            doing the things I love in my free time.
